#0x1A. C - Hash tables

## Learning objectives:
- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## General requirements:
- Global variables are not allowed
- C standard library is allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Header file should be called `hash_tables.h`
- Typedef data structures provided: `hash_node_t` and `hash_table_t`

## Additional information:
### Python dictionaries
Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. So much is actually happening when you type d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, but everything looks so simple for the user.
